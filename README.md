Creating a simple e-commerce website clone involves creating a basic structure using HTML, 
adding some styling using CSS, and enhancing interactivity with JavaScript. 

In this example, we've created a simple product listing page with two products.
Users can click "Add to Cart" to add products to their cart, and the selected items and total price are displayed in a shopping cart section.

This is a basic representation and doesn't cover backend processing, payment integration, 
or user authentication, which are essential for a complete e-commerce website. However,
this example should provide a starting point to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create a simple e-commerce page.
